# 🤖 Jarvis AI — Voice Assistant Powered by Gemini

Welcome to **Jarvis AI** — your own personal voice assistant, inspired by Tony Stark's **Iron Man** universe!

This project brings to life a lightweight desktop assistant that listens to your voice commands and responds intelligently using Google's **Gemini LLM** (Generative AI). From opening websites to answering your questions with natural language understanding — **Jarvis is here to help**.

---

## 🔥 Features

- 🎤 **Voice Command Recognition** (via `speech_recognition`)
- 🧠 **Natural Language Understanding** using **Gemini-Pro** (Free Tier)
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech Responses** using `espeak`
- 🌐 Built-in commands to open YouTube, Google, Wikipedia
- 🕒 Tells the current time
- ⚙️ Easy to customize and extend

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Google Generative AI SDK** (`gemini-pro`)
- `speech_recognition`
- `espeak` (Linux TTS)
- `pyaudio` (for mic input)

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-ai
   cd jarvis-ai
````

2. **Install dependencies manually**:

   ```bash
   pip install speechrecognition pyaudio google-generativeai
   ```

3. **Set your Gemini API Key**:

   * Create a `config.py` file:

     ```python
     gemini_api_key = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
     ```

4. **Run the assistant**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
